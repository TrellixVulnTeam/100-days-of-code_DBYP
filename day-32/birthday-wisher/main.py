# 1. Update the birthdays.csv with your friends & family's details. 
# HINT: Make sure one of the entries matches today's date for testing purposes. e.g.
#name,email,year,month,day
#YourName,your_own@email.com,today_year,today_month,today_day

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Create a tuple from today's month and day using datetime. e.g.
today = dt.datetime.now()
today_tuple = (today.month, today.day)

# HINT 2: Use pandas to read the birthdays.csv
data = pd.read_csv("birthdays.csv")

# HINT 3: Use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from birthday.csv that is formated like this:
birthdays_dict = {(data_row["month"], data_row["day"]): data_row for (index, data_row) in data.iterrows()}

#HINT 4: Then you could compare and see if today's month/day tuple matches one of the keys in birthday_dict like this:
if today_tuple in birthdays_dict:
    birthday_person = birthdays_dict[today_tuple]
    file_path = f"letter_templates/letter_{random.randint(1,3)}.txt"
    with open(file_path) as letter_file:
        contents = letter_file.read()
        contents = contents.replace("[NAME]", birthday_person["name"])

    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com") as connection:
        connection.starttls()
        connection.login(MY_EMAIL, MY_PASSWORD)
        connection.sendmail(from_addr=MY_EMAIL, to_addrs=birthday_person["email"], msg=f"Subject:Happy Birthday!\n\n{contents}".encode("utf-8"))
